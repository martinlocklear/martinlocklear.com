            Hello! This the personal website of Martin Locklear - I'm a remote software engineer currently based out of Greenpoint, Brooklyn in NYC.  I'm using this
            site to brush up on my front-end skills (I'm primarily backend focused) - more coming soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hire me!  Eventually my resume will be located here - in the mean time, check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinlocklear/">LinkedIn</a>. I'm
            most interested in discussing fully remote roles in fully remote teams.
